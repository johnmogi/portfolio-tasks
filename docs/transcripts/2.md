Perfect! I've fixed the syntax error. The issue was an extra closing brace that was causing the JavaScript to fail parsing. 

Now that the syntax error is resolved, you should see the saved items when you refresh your browser. The application includes **5 demo tasks** that load automatically on first visit:

### ðŸ”„ **To see the saved items:**

1. **Refresh your browser** at `http://localhost:8000`
2. **You should now see 5 sample tasks:**
   - âœ… "Complete project proposal" (Work)
   - âœ… "Review design mockups" (Design) 
   - âœ… "Team meeting preparation" (Work) - marked as done
   - âœ… "Update portfolio website" (Personal)
   - âœ… "Learn new JavaScript framework" (Learning)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Try these features now:**

- **Mark tasks complete/incomplete** using the checkboxes
- **Edit tasks** by clicking the "Edit" button
- **Delete tasks** with the "Delete" button (with confirmation)
- **Filter by category** using the dropdown
- **Toggle grouping** to group tasks by category
- **Add new tasks** and see them persist

The JavaScript should now load properly without any syntax errors, and you'll see your tasks displayed in the table. The app uses localStorage, so any changes you make will be saved automatically!
