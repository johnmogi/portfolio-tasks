I see you're getting a JavaScript syntax error on line 638. Looking at the code structure, it appears the [toggleTaskStatus](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/USUARIO/Documents/PROJECTS/courses/portfolio/assets/app.js:596:4-611:5) function is missing its closing brace. 

**The Issue:**
The [toggleTaskStatus](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/USUARIO/Documents/PROJECTS/courses/portfolio/assets/app.js:596:4-611:5) function starts at line 622 but doesn't have a proper closing brace before the final `});` that closes the document ready function.

**The Fix Needed:**
Line 637 should be:
```javascript
    }  // Close toggleTaskStatus function
});     // Close document ready function
```

**How would you like to proceed?**
1. I can provide you with the exact text to manually add the missing brace in your editor
2. Or if you have a different approach in mind, let me know

The missing brace is right after the [showToast](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/USUARIO/Documents/PROJECTS/courses/portfolio/assets/app.js:403:4-435:5) call in the [toggleTaskStatus](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/USUARIO/Documents/PROJECTS/courses/portfolio/assets/app.js:596:4-611:5) function. Would you like me to show you exactly where to add it?
