Perfect! I've started a local HTTP server for your To-Do Portfolio website. 

🌐 **Your website is now live at: http://localhost:8000**

You can now test all the features you built:

### 🎯 **What to Test:**
1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Try adding tasks** with different categories and colors
3. **Test the CRUD operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete
4. **Mark tasks as complete** using the status checkboxes
5. **Filter by category** using the dropdown
6. **Toggle row grouping** to see tasks grouped by category
7. **Test overdue highlighting** - tasks with past deadlines will show in red
8. **Try the import/export** functionality to backup your data

### 📱 **Features Available:**
- ✅ Responsive Bootstrap 5 design
- ✅ DataTables with search, sort, and pagination  
- ✅ localStorage persistence (data survives page refresh)
- ✅ Category filtering and row grouping
- ✅ Overdue task highlighting
- ✅ Toast notifications for actions
- ✅ Import/Export JSON backup

The server will continue running in the background. Simply refresh your browser to see any changes you make to the code. Your To-Do Portfolio is ready to use! 🎉
